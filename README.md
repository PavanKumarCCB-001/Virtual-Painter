# Virtual-Painter

This is the Desktop Application that I've Developed using Python, that allows Users to Draw on Virtual Canvas by simply moving their Hand.

This project leverages libraries such as OpenCV for hand detection and tracking, providing an intuitive and interactive way for users to create digital art without the need for traditional input devices like a mouse or stylus.




## Installation

There are 3 Libraries that needs to be installed inorder to execute this code:

1 . Media Pipe

```bash
  pip install mediapipe
  
```
2 . Numpy

```bash
  pip install numpy
  
```

3 . OpenCv or cv2

```bash
  pip install opencv
  
```
